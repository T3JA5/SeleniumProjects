ACEDIMIC PROJECT:  
 
PROJECT 1: 
 
Title: Smart ATM 
Domain: Embedded Programming 
Team Size: 3 
Role: Embedded programming for PIC16f452 
Description: 
 
Automated Teller Machines (ATMs) security and monitoring is the field of study that 
aims at solutions that provide multiple points of protection against physical theft and 
electronic faults. The implementation is achieved with the use of Machine-to-machine 
(M2M) communications technology. System’s main objective is to monitor the faulty 
conditions like power-cut for long time, no cash in the cash register, absence of internet 
connectivity and no printer paper roll. With the proper knowledge about the fault, it 
conveys the message to consumer as well as the authority. 
The Main motive of this design is to Prevent ATM theft and monitoring the different 
objective about ATM. Many real time Incidents around us has been the main motivation 
of this Project. 
 
PROJECT 2: 
 
Title: Smart Solar panel 
Domain: Embedded Programming   
Team Size: 2 
Role: Embedded programming for PIC16f877A 
Description: 
 
Sun Tracking System for Solar panel project is made to tracking the Sun at day time for 
utilizing its solar energy properly for solar panel. The Sun trackers are all-weather, 
reliable and affordable tracking and positioning instruments. This project orients the 
Solar Panel toward the sun, so that it can utilize with higher accuracy. Our Sun Tracker 
system track the Sun by use of microcontrollers and rotate the solar panel by means of 
stepper motor. 
For flat-panel applications, trackers are used to minimize the angle of incidence between 
the incoming light and a solar panel. This increases the amount of energy produced 
from a fixed amount of installed power generating capacity.
